# 🦾 Aionic – AI-Powered Adaptive Prosthetic Arm

Aionic is an advanced prosthetic arm that uses AI-driven grip control powered by EMG signals. It adapts grip strength in real-time based on feedback from force and torque sensors. The arm learns from interactions using reinforcement learning, enabling intelligent handling of objects of different sizes, shapes, and materials.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Based Grip Adjustment**: Uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune grip based on object feedback.
- **EMG-Controlled**: Detects muscle signals using sEMG sensors for gesture recognition.
- **Hybrid Control System**: Optional integration of EEG signals for improved intent accuracy.
- **Force & Torque Feedback**: Ensures safe and optimal grasp on different objects.
- **Smart Companion App**: Gesture training, voice control (via Gemini API), and cloud dashboards (Google IDX).
- **Continuous Learning**: Learns from failed gestures and self-improves over time.
